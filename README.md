**Welcome to MoviesRatesAPI.**

This API is designed to allow you to observe the difference in currency exchange rates between the provided date and one day prior. 
The base currency is the Lithuanian Litas, so the dates you can provide are only before December 21, 2014.

This API was created using .NET Core and a PostgreSQL database.

Instructions on how to run it:

1. Suggest you to run it with docker-compose, thus you will have database set and all migrations ran for you.
1'. Sure you can run it otherwise, just don't forget to manually create movies database and run migrations/sql scripts.
2. After you have it all set, you can enjoy testing my API with Postman collections that I prepared for you.
